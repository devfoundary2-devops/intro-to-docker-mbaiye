# Introduction to Docker Assignment

For this assignment, you have a broken `app.py` file. You have to carry out the following to fix the file and application:
- Ensure the `redis` initialization works properly.
- Add error checks to the redis get and set endpoints in your app
- Use the postgres database in your application
- Ensure that a `docker compose up -d` run spins up:
  - The fastapi app
  - The redis cache
  - The postgres db.

You are free to use whatever resources available to you in solving this
task. All that is required is a fully functional docker compose application.
